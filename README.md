I am actually cloning a UI design of an app in Playstore. forgot password section might look flawed but not so, the original app send password reset code to the users email and then require it before typing a new password; Couldn't get a wrap around that using Google Firebase cuz it doesn't support it somehow. Still working on it though. So, I just built the UI for those part, and I'm using [Fake store API](https://fakestoreapi.com) for store back-end.
